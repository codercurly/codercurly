## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @codercurly (GÃ¼l)

I'm a Flutter developer with real-world experience building and publishing mobile applications.  
I work with both BLoC and Provider for state management, and Iâ€™ve developed full-featured apps with backend integration using PHP and REST APIs.

ðŸ“± One of my social apps is live on the Play Store â€“ built with Provider and a custom PHP backend.  
Iâ€™m currently working on a proposal/project management app using BLoC.

ðŸ’¡ Tech Stack:
- Flutter & Dart  
- BLoC, Provider  
- Firebase, REST APIs, PHP  
- Git & GitHub  

ðŸ“Œ Open to remote or freelance opportunities in mobile development.
